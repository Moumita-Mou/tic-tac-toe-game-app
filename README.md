- Additional dependencies will be installed via `npm install`.

## Usage

Once the app is up and running, you can:

- Play a standard **Tic Tac Toe** game with a friend.

3. Verify that Node.js is properly installed by checking the version:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

4. Ensure the Expo Go app is installed on your mobile device for testing.
